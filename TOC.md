Chapter 4: The Monero network for beginners
- Elements of cryptography (non-technical section)
	- Hashes (general concept)
	- Nonces (general concept)
- The simplified anatomy of a block
	- Nodes are the network backbone
	- Nodes relay network data to peers
	- Nodes store the blockchain
	- “Local nodes” versus “remote nodes”
- Miners create new blocks
		 - Miners add new blocks onto the longest chain
		 - A difficult task ensures stability and fairness
		 - Monero “taxis” use a hard puzzle to ensure fairness
		 - Miners are paid for their service
- Proof of Work systems
	- Benefits
		- Censorship resistance
	- The “difficulty” adjusts time between blocks
	- The RandomX algorithm
		- Context: The history of Bitcoin mining
		- ASICs enable dangerous centralization
		- Monero actively resists ASICs
		- Moving from CryptoNight to RandomX
	- Brief note on PoW alternatives
- PoW concept summary
