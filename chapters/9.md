## Problems and Troubleshooting

*Problem: I transferred Moneroj to my wallet, but my balance is still 0*

**Available solutions**

**1**) Check if you copied the correct Monero Address (sometimes malware can try to edit the
copied Monero address);

**2**) Verify whether transaction actually arrived at your wallet / address by these steps:

    A. Go to the Settings page of the GUI and press on Show seed & keys. Subsequently,
    copy the private view key.
    
    B. Go to https://xmrchain.net/ blockexplorer
    
    C. Enter your transaction ID / hash.
    
    D. Now search the page for Decode outputs.
    
    E. Enter your private view key. In addition, enter your address in the second box.
    
    F. Press on decode outputs.
    
    G. If it shows "output true" it proves you correctly received your XMR
    
**3**)Verify if you are connected to the blockchain (using either remote nodes or local daemon;

If everything above checks out it's most likely a visibility bug, meaning that your Moneroj are in the correct place, but your wallet has not yet found them. The Monero GUI uses a local cache that can take a few seconds to refresh, especially on Windows. If this problem persists, try to reach our channels for support (see chapter V).
