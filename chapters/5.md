# Monero Core and Community

## Monero Community 

If you take a look at Monero history, you will see that community is a very important part of its development; The community behind Monero is a crucial part of it's history and development. Starting at it's inception, the anonymous founder of the BitMonero cryptocurrency made sweeping changes without asking a solid feedback from the community, and when he made mistakes, the community of BitMonero decided to fork the software and continue to develop it without him. BitMonero was shortly renamed Monero by consensus of the community. The community has been trailblazing ever since.

One of the greatest strengths of Monero is it's community; each month there are two Monero-community meetings where everyone can follow the progresses about Monero and frequents developer meetings that are open for the community to join or follow on IRC (#monero or #monero-dev on Freenode). Contributers and community members are encouraged to comment on development and ideas on the Monero Project Github. 

Originally, the community was composed of just a few people (the original fans of Monero), but by early 2018, the community grew a lot: over 150,000 users on social networks! Other sub-communities have begun to grow around Monero. These sub-communities range from miners, developers, organizers, entrepreneurs, marketers, engineers and more.


There have been 330 people who have contributed code, with 140 in 2017. The organization scheme of the project has been described as “un-governance”. The “ungovernance” model, as implemented by Monero, is comprised of four different aspects or “branches”: the Monero Research Group, the Monero Community Group, the Monero Workgroups and the Monero Core. 

The Monero Research Group is an open group of academics and researchers who are constantly coming up with new ideas for Monero and testing and researching existing ideas. 

The Monero Community Group performs functions like posting on the subreddit, helping out newcomers, updating the Monero website, providing feedbacks, and building out the ecosystem. 

The Monero Workgroups are special Workgroups created with a unique goal: joining people for the same tasks. For example, there is Monero Hardware Workgroup that has the mission to build the first community-driven Hardware Wallet (a secure way to store cryptocurrency off devices connected to the internet). Another example could be the Monero Integrations Workgroup that has the mission to build free and open source payment gateways (tools to help increase usability and adoption of Monero).

Finally, the Monero Core Team is the team that manages critical tasks for Monero. Some of the responsibilities of the Core Team are:

* Acting as primary trusted arbiters of the Forum Funding System on behalf of the community, so as to ensure the completion of all projects to the satisfaction of the community.
* Managing the codebase of the Monero Project, which includes merging code on Github, keeping backups, and ensuring the safety, security, and free access of the code from any party.
* Stewarding the general donation fund, and spending the Monero there on anything they see fit to further the Monero Project.
* Acting as trusted signers and distributors of reference clients for the Monero coin, and other related technologies.
* Setting a vision for the Monero Project

## Monero Core

Repository of Monero on Github:

* monero The Core of Monero Network, written in C++ language
* monero-gui GUI for Monero, build with Qt library
* monero-site The website for Monero
* sekura The Community Hardware wallet
* kovri The Kovri I2P Router Project 
* kovri-site The website for Kovri

Over 200 contributors in the past year have contributed to Monero codebase (that includes the Monero “core”) and over 500 users have created Monero related projects ranging from online payment and wallet services, usability and adoption, and even artwork and merchandise that have contributed to the cultural fabric of the Monero community.

There are not many cryptocurrencies with a community as strong as Monero's. Anyone in the future who benefits from Monero, has this entire community to thank.
