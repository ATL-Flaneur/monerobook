# How Monero works

The first two chapters covered everything you need to know about WHY to use Monero (Chapter 1 ) and HOW to use Monero (Chapter 2). By now, you have learned everything necessary to begin using Monero yourself!

The rest of this book contains extra details, for those wishing to dive deeper into how Monero works “behind the scenes.” Chapters 3 and 4 describe underlying technologies such as Monero’s privacy features, the blockchain, and the mining process - focusing on the understanding concepts, without digressing into the advanced mathematics​. Chapters 5 through {?} contain those nitty-gritty details for developers and cryptography geeks.

## Transaction and the Ledger

To set the stage for understanding Monero privacy technologies, we will consider how Monero are sent and received on the ledger. For this chapter, we will focus on blockchain functionality - an inherently tamper-proof shared database that keeps a list of Monero transactions. The details about blockchain security (mining, hashes, etc) are another topic, reserved for Chapter 4.

When you set up your wallet, it uses your secret “seed” to mathematically calculate sets of “public keys” and their corresponding “private keys” (technical details in chapter X). This process is carried out on your device, and can be executed offline; nothing is broadcast or recorded by the network during wallet generation.

You share your address (created from your public keys) to receive funds, which you can then access with your corresponding private keys. Until somebody sends you Monero, there will not be any entries on the blockchain that your private keys can unlock.

When somebody (a customer, an exchange, or a friend) sends you Monero, they will transmit a transaction that transfers some of their Menoroj to a new address that you can unlock with your private keys. In technical lingo, the “output” of their transaction is stored on the blockchain, for you to spend with your private keys at your leisure

This jargon can be a bit confusing, since the cryptocurrency use of the word “output” is different from the typical meaning. All of the Moneroj that you “own” are simply outputs on the blockchain that your private keys unlock. 

Each time you receive Monero, you gain another output; each time you spend Monero, you use up one of your outputs and generate a new one for somebody else.

When your wallet is “scanning” or “syncing” this usually means that it is checking all of the outputs on the blockchain to test whether your private keys unlock any for you to spend. Your wallet “balance” is the total sum of these outputs that you can unlock. When you spend your Monero, you use up some of your outputs as “inputs” to a transaction that you broadcast to the network. Conceptually, the blockchain is simply a record of these transactions, each consuming the sender’s outputs as inputs, to generate a new output for the recipient.

The process described above is slightly simplified, to convey the crucial parts (private/public keys, transactions, inputs/outputs). The following sections delve into more details about how Monero’s privacy technologies.

## Privacy Technology Overview

The general principles and terminology introduced above are shared by most cryptocurrencies. Monero provides enhanced functionality and privacy through several unique cryptographic technologies that shield the users and their activity from public visibility. Figure X shows which features protect which transaction details:

* RingCT conceals the transaction amount
* Ring signatures obfuscate the sender
* One-time addresses ensure that the recipient address is not recorded on the blockchain
* Kovri breaks the link between your transactions and physical location by obfuscating the broadcast origin and concealing network signs of Monero activity
