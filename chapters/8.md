## Specific Instructions for Official Monero GUI

The following instructions show how to carry out the tasks described above through the Monero graphical user interface (GUI). If you are using a different wallet, you can skip this section.

### 1. Choose a language

The official Monero GUI can be downloaded from [https://getmonero.org/downloads](https://getmonero.org/downloads). Once you have unpackaged and launched the application, you will be presented with a language selection screen:

If you don’t see your language above, please feel free to [submit a translation to help others](https://github.com/monero-project/monero-gui/tree/master/translations)! Once you select a language, the GUI will ask whether you wish to generate a new seed, or restore an existing wallet.

### 2. Specify an option
  
The Monero GUI offers three options for wallet type: Mainnet, Testnet, and Stagenet. 

Choose Mainnet (default option) to access the regular blockchain with real Monero. The Testnet and Stagenet are two separate blockchains that are used by developers for developing and testing new code. The Testnet and Stagenet Monero do not have any real monetary value, and cannot be transferred to the mainnet.

If this is your first Monero wallet, press “create new wallet.” The Monero software will generate a new seed for you, and show you the 25-word seed mnemonic.

### 3. Write down the seed

Remember, the seed is not like a password! The network cannot restore access to your funds if you lose your seed.

Be sure to write this down and store it in a safe place where nobody else will find it!


### 4. Enter a password
You can enter a wallet password to keep your fund secure if somebody else accesses your computer. The wallet password is a local security feature, like a PIN screen unlock. It does not impact the cryptography or how your moneroj are stored on the blockchain, so restoring your wallet from the seed will bypass the local passphrase.

### 5. Download the Monero blockchain

Next, you will have the option to start your own node, or connect to a remote node.

Running your own node requires at least 60 GB of diskspace to store the blockchain. If your devices has limited resources, you can select “connect to a remote node” to configure a lightweight wallet that accesses data stored elsewhere. You can learn more about the pros and cons of using a remote node in section 4.2.3 “Local nodes” versus “remote nodes”.
   
## Then.. Welcome to Monero GUI!


### 8.1.2 Receiving Monero with the GUI

The “Receive” tab of the Monero GUI contains both the text and QR-code forms of your receiving addresses. The “Create new address” button generates more “subaddresses,” which will all direct to this same wallet (seed). If you are charging somebody for a particular amount, you can enter the “Amount,” which will then be encoded into the QR code.

### 8.1.3 Sending Monero with the GUI

To send Monero, you simply specify the amount that you wish to send, and the recipient's address. The Payment ID field can be left blank, unless your recipient specifies a Payment ID in advance. The Description field is stored locally, so you can leave notes for yourself. These will not be recovered if you restore your wallet from a seed.

### Transaction History

### 8.1.4 Proof of Payment with the GUI

Proof of payment verification is available through the GUI under “prove/check.” The screenshoot above shows the transaction ID, address, and transaction key from the Maria & Kahn example in chapter 2.

## 8.2 Specific instruction for Monero Wallet CLI

The following instructions show how to carry out the tasks described above through the Monero command line interface (CLI). If you are using a different wallet, you can skip this section.

### 8.2.1 Setting up a wallet with the CLI

The official Monero CLI can be downloaded from https://getmonero.org/downloads. The command for running the CLI varies depending on your operating system. In Linux, simply launch ./monero-wallet-cli from the program folder. You can add extra flags (documented in this Chapter) if you wish to connect to a remote node, bind your IP address, or other advanced options.

    $ wget https://downloads.getmonero.org/cli/linux64

### 8.2.2 Receiving Monero
You can find out your address by typing address. If you wish to combine the address with a payment ID, you can type integrated_address to generate a random payment ID, or you can specify a particular ID as an input argument, such as:

    [wallet 433bhJ]: integrated_address 12346780abcdef00

## Problems and Troubleshooting

*Problem: I transferred Moneroj to my wallet, but my balance is still 0*

**Available solutions**

**1**) Check if you copied the correct Monero Address (sometimes malware can try to edit the
copied Monero address);

**2**) Verify whether transaction actually arrived at your wallet / address by these steps:

    A. Go to the Settings page of the GUI and press on Show seed & keys. Subsequently,
    copy the private view key.
    
    B. Go to https://xmrchain.net/ blockexplorer
    
    C. Enter your transaction ID / hash.
    
    D. Now search the page for Decode outputs.
    
    E. Enter your private view key. In addition, enter your address in the second box.
    
    F. Press on decode outputs.
    
    G. If it shows "output true" it proves you correctly received your XMR
    
**3**) Verify if you are connected to the blockchain (using either remote nodes or local daemon)

If everything above checks out it's most likely a visibility bug, meaning that your Moneroj are in the correct place, but your wallet has not yet found them. The Monero GUI uses a local cache that can take a few seconds to refresh, especially on Windows. If this problem persists, try to reach our channels for support (see chapter V).
