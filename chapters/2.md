# Chapter 2

# Getting Started
The last chapter focused on WHY to use Monero; in this chapter you will learn HOW to use Monero. You can master using Monero without needing to learn any of the complex cryptographic or network technical details, so that extra information is saved for later in the book. **Chapter 2 will cover all the practical skills you’ll need to get started receiving,
storing, and spending your Moneroj**.

**The first part of this chapter covers key concepts and terminology for Monero use, as general information that will apply to any wallet or software.** Toward the end of the chapter, you’ll find handy guides for carrying out these steps using the free official open-source Monero command line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI) software.

## What is a Wallet?

Before you obtain some Moneroj, you must plan ahead for where you will receive and store your funds. You will need a “wallet” to help you store and spend your Moneroj. Just like physical wallets for your bills, there are lots of different types of Monero wallets, and you can always move some of your money from an old wallet to a new one.

Wallets take care of the complicated cryptographic processes for you, so you don’t need to know any fancy mathematics to use Monero. You will only need to manage a seed and your address(es). Other details like “public keys” and “private keys” are managed behind-the-scenes by your wallet, so they are not discussed until chapter VI.

Your Monero seed is a secret number that your wallet uses to locate and spend your Moneroj, though it is converted into a series of 12-25+ words for convenience. This secret is like a treasure map to your money on the blockchain, and anybody who learns your seed can use their wallet to access and spend your Moneroj. For this reason, you must be extremely careful when you generate and store your seed. Do not set up a wallet in a coffee shop, where other patrons or cameras may see your secret. It is dangerous to store your seed electronically (e.g. in a text file or email) since malicious software or services may run off with your Moneroj.

Your seed is used to generate your address(es), which you can share with others. Most wallets will show your address in two different formats - a written string of numbers/letters, and a visual QR code. These are redundant, and you can safely share either form.

If your wallet is physically damaged, you can simply import your seed into a new wallet, and pick up right where you left off! As long as you have a copy of your seed, you can always access your funds. However, if you lose your seed, there is no way to ever recover access to your Moneroj. You may be familiar with passwords, which can usually be reset by contacting an administrator. **Seeds are not like passwords** - nobody else knows your secret, and the network is unable to shift your Moneroj to a account if you lose the old one.

Most software will prompt you to write down the seed when you initialize a new wallet, however some apps do this in the background, and you must take the initiative to backup your wallet. Be sure to do this immediately, or else a damaged device will cause you to permanently lose your funds.

## Selecting the best wallets for your needs

There are various storage solutions, and they vary in terms of convenience, privacy, and security. Your individual needs will determine which type(s) of wallets are best for you. Many people use multiple storage solutions: often a convenient “hot wallet” that holds small amounts for day-to-day use, complemented by a more secure “cold wallet” for long-term savings or large amounts. The varying wallet types described below differ primarily in where the keys are stored.

## Software and Mobile Wallets

Software wallets (on a desktop PC or mobile device) are convenient for storing and using Monero. Many Monero users have a handy “hot wallet” on their phones, to pay for small purchases. A good rule of thumb is to only walk around carrying as much cryptocurrency money as you would feel comfortable holding in regular cash. The keys are stored on your device, so
your Moneroj could be stolen if you catch a virus or keylogger.

## Hardware Wallets

Hardware wallets are special physical devices that generate your seed, store the keys based on your seed and carry out transactions, while never revealing your secret information to the connected device. While hardware wallets are less convenient than software wallets, they are extremely secure! Because of how they store your seed, you can safely use a hardware wallet to send transactions from a device that you suspect or know is compromised with malicious software.

## Paper Wallets

Paper wallets provide an inexpensive way to stash Moneroj that you do not plan to move frequently; you simply print out a physical copy of your public and secret information for safe storage. Since the secrets from your Monero seed are saved only on paper, not digitally, you do not have to worry about viruses or data leaks. However, paper wallets are not convenient for
frequent use, since you must transfer the secrets to a digital device every time you wish to send Moneroj.

## Web Wallets

Web wallets refer to platforms running on third-party services that you control through their website. Web are extremely convenient, at the expense of security and privacy. The wallet is only as trusted as the third party, and there are extra security risks associated with accessing your Moneroj through a web browser. Some of the more secure web wallets are designed to keep the seed and secrets on your device as [MyMonero](https://mymonero.com). If a web wallet provider is going to hold your seed on their computers (and let you log in to access your funds) then you should be very suspicious.

## Cold Wallets

Cold wallets refer to any device that is generally kept offline and used only for storing your secrets. They could use any operating system, and you must be very deliberate with strong security (including a firewall, antivirus, and extreme caution regarding accessing only trusted websites/software). The seed is still on the computer, however you keep the device sequestered from the rest of the world, as much as possible.
