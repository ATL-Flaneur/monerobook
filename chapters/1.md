# Introduction to cryptocurrencies & Monero
Maria is purchasing a car from George, and in this chapter we'll consider three different ways that she could pay him: traditional banks, transparent cryptocurrencies (e.g. Bitcoin), and Monero.

## 1.1 Payment through banks

If Maria sends the money to George through the traditional banking system, they trust two intermediate parties (their respective banks) to symbolically move the funds for them.

There is no actual movement of physical bills or assets; both banks simply edit their respective databases to show that the funds have been transferred. When Maria submits the transaction to her bank (whether by wire transfer, her bank's website, or an app), her bank subtracts $2,500 from her account balance on their ledger, then contacts George's bank and requests that they add $2,500 to George's balance.

There are a few drawbacks and risks to this system, and it requires total trust in the banks. Maria, George, and the banks must act on faith that transactions are legitimate and that the ledgers are kept honestly. This trust in the intermediate third parties poses a risk, since a nefarious actor or the banks could “create” money by fraudulently editing the ledger balances or transaction database.

Furthermore, Maria does not actually have possession of $3900, only an IOU from her bank that she must trust is redeemable. She has no way to audit her bank to verify whether they actually have $3900.

In fact, they may not hold that much, since most banks legally operate on _fractional reserve_ - meaning that their actual assets are allowed to be significantly less than the total balance promised to account owners.

Depending on how the funds were sent, it could take anywhere from minutes to days before the $2,500 shows up in George's bank account. Since George is not privy to the banks' ledgers or communications, the entire process is opaque and cannot be monitored.

Many people that have not personally experienced economic disruption take functioning banks and the validity of their IOUs for granted. Few individuals consider the unsettling ramifications of handing their lifelong savings to opaque corporations, often putting all their eggs in a single institutional basket. Losses can occur due to:

* negligence (the bank makes a mistake)

* financial issues (the bank overextends their assets or goes out of business)

* malice and corruption (the bank or a rogue employee steals your money)

* hostile third parties (the bank is robbed or a hacker thieves electronic funds)

Thankfully, an emerging new blockchain technology is capable of mitigating all of the above risks by creating a distributed ledger that all parties can equally use, view, and verify. This remarkable capability for strangers to agree on a shared document, which is called decentralized consensus, has been revolutionized in the last decade.

It's easy to be confused about the terminology at first, especially since most people are simultaneously introduced to several jargony concepts. You can think about "blockchains" as a technology that allows networks to establish "decentralized consensus" agreements.
By enabling strangers to safely share a ledger, it becomes possible to build "cryptocurrencies" that function as digital cash. There are a multitude of regular currencies (euros, dollars, yen, etc); analogously, various teams have built many different cryptocurrencies (Monero, Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc).

## 1.2 Introduction to blockchains

Anybody can learn all about Monero and how its blockchain works without having to understand the underlying mathematics and
cryptography (similar to how anybody can become internet-savvy without first studying DNS servers and the IPv6 protocol). **This chapter focuses on the key concepts and vocabulary without digging into all of the technical details** - you can jump ahead to chapter 4 and chapter 5 if you want to dive into the cryptographic framework.

### 1.2.1 What is a blockchain?

The term _blockchain_ refers to a particular method for securing records in a database that all network users share. It is groundbreaking for being a _trustless_ system, where individuals retain full autonomy over their funds, there is no central authority, and each participant can easily verify and audit the system.

Anyone in the world is welcome to act as a network maintainer, and each participant keeps the others honest by verifying the blockchain. When users broadcast information to be placed on the blockchain, network maintainers group these transmissions into blocks and use cryptographic tools to finalize the records and permanently link them onto the blockchain.

Once data is sealed onto the blockchain, it cannot be deleted, moved, or altered in any way. The records are immutable and each participant on the network has matching copy of the blockchain for their own verification. Most cryptocurrency blockchains employ a clever mining model that encourages network participation and keeps all of the records honest and synchronized. These types of decentralized systems are incredibly robust since there is no single server or central database that can be maliciously attacked or manipulated.

These decentralized systems are also trustless since each participant in the network maintains and verifies their own copy of the records, instead of relying on any third party. Given that blockchains provide a system for global tamperproof recordkeeping, they are extremely well-suited for storing financial data. In fact, the first modern distributed blockchain debuted in 2008 as the mechanism underlying the Bitcoin cryptocurrency.

On October 31st 2008, an anonymous individual or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto published a whitepaper describing “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” This world-changing document laid out the framework for the open-source decentralized cryptocurrency and the revolutionary blockchain technology that makes it possible. 

Figure 1.1 in the first section highlighted how sending money through the traditional banking system requires multiple transactions, separate ledgers, and trust in more than one bank. Figure 1.5 (below) shows how Maria could send money to George by transferring 10.5 Bitcoin from her address (1BuUygisXY) to an address controlled by George (1eK5FSywkp). This example references Bitcoin (BTC) for convenience, however nearly all cryptocurrencies use this type of public ledger and thus experience the following benefits and issues.

### 1.2.2 Blockchain benefits

A few of the blockchain benefits are immediately apparent:

* **Simplicity (& speed)**: Maria's money is broadcast to George in a single step to update a single ledger. Whereas bank and wire transfers can take days or weeks, cryptocurrency ledgers typically update in seconds or minutes (the transaction confirmation time varies for different cryptocurrencies).

* **No third-party risks**: Maria and George rely on their own cryptographically-secured and self-maintained system instead of placing their money and trust in the hands of third parties.

* **Pseudo-anonymity**: Unlike the banks, cryptocurrency ledgers never record real names such as “Maria” and “George” with
the accounts. In fact, personal information is never necessary for generating an cryptocurrency wallet. George will access the funds pseudonymously, using his key for the 1eK5FSywkp address to which Maria broadcasted the money (from her account, 1BuUygisXY).

Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies that followed have initiated a financial revolution that is still unfolding. With these new decentralized networks, anybody can personally store and globally transfer funds at their own discretion. Prior to cryptocurrencies, it was difficult to store large amounts of wealth securely without trusting your savings to banks or credit unions. Likewise, transferring money to another individual or business required reliance on third-party payment processors for checks, wire transfers, or credit/debit cards.

Thanks to cryptocurrencies, for the first time, anybody can exercise their basic financial rights without requiring access to a bank and approval from external institutions! In mere moments, any device (computer, phone, tablet) can be used to initialize a new cryptocurrency wallet that is fully functional for receiving, storing, and sending funds. Setting up a wallet does not require any kind of identification, fees, or authorization, since the system identifies users by addresses that look like random strings of numbers and letters instead of personally identifiable details such as names, street addresses, or phone numbers.

### 1.2.3 Blockchain drawbacks

Most cryptocurrencies are pseudo-anonymous, since their users are identified by unintelligible strings of letters and numbers rather than personal identifiers. When you receive a cryptocurrency payment, you do not learn the sender's name; instead, you receive the funds from an address such as: 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa.

While this preserves privacy in some ways, it also exposes some sensitive information. Recall, every participant in a decentralized blockchain system can access a complete copy of the entire set of records. In the context of cryptocurrencies, this ledger is used to ascertain the account balance for any (e.g. Bitcoin) address.

On these shared transparent ledgers every account balance and history is public! In fact, several helpful websites allow you to easily search the blockchain for any address or transaction.
