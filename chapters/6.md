# Cryptography deep

The cryptography behind Monero is what makes it more secure, private, and untraceable than all other cryptocurrencies. This chapter will take a deep dive into it's cryptography features. Due to the mathmetical nature of cryptography, this chapter is the most technical of this book. So, to start at the basics, we'll begin with cryptographic primitives.

A cryptographic primitive is an algorithm that serves as the building block for cryptographic protocols. Monero uses a wide variety of cryptographic primitives for various use cases, which will be discussed in depth throughout this chapter.

Monero uses a wide variety of cryptographic primitives for various use cases.

Comparing to Bitcoin, Monero uses much more primitives, and some of them are more advanced, especially those related to privacy and Proof of Work. Some choices are deliberately non-standard (for better or worse) - oftentimes a legacy of the CryptoNote protocol.  

Comparing to various altcoins, the multiple primitives of Monero cryptography is often considered more conservative, sound and robust. So let's take a look at what they are specifically.

## Monero PseudoRandom Number Generation (PRNG)

A pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), also known as a deterministic random bit generator (DRBG),[1] is an algorithm for generating a sequence of numbers whose properties approximate the properties of sequences of random numbers. The PRNG-generated sequence is not truly random, because it is completely determined by an initial value, called the PRNG's seed (which may include truly random values).

Monero uses PRNG based on the Keccak hashing function. Basically, output of the previous hashing round is input for the next one.

The initial seed comes from entropy sources provided by operating system. On Linux and MacOS the seed comes from /dev/urandom. On Windows the WinAPI CryptGenRandom call is used for seeding.

This concerns the reference C++ implementation of Monero. Please note there are many alternative implementations of private key generation, including JavaScript, Python, Android/Java. These should be researched case by case for correctness.

## Hashing

For generating addresses (especially public address), it's important to hash keys. Hashing is a protection for the problem of pseudorandom generation of numbers. Sometimes the algorithm could be predictable and that w

Monero employs Keccak as a hashing function. In most contexts specifically a special version of this is used, called Keccak-256, providing 32-byte hashes.

Choosing a good hashing algorithm is a must for creating addresses in a secure way. If it generates the same addresses, there will be a "collision" (two people will have the same seed, so same private and public keys).

### Keccak

Keccak is the leading hashing function, designed by non-NSA designers. Keccak won NIST competition to become the official SHA3. It is used for transaction and block hashing.

## Base58

Base58 is a group of binary-to-text encoding schemes used to represent large integers as alphanumeric text. 

It is similar to another scheme called Base64 but has been modified to avoid both non-alphanumeric characters and letters which might look ambiguous when printed. 

It is therefore designed for human users who manually enter the data, copying from some visual source, but also allows easy copy and paste because a double-click will usually select the whole string.

Base58 Alphabet used in Monero:

123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz

Note: Zero (0) along with the letters I (uppercase i), O (uppercase o), and l (lowercase L) are not present in this Base58 alphabet as they are the previously mentioned characters which might appear ambiguous.

# The relationships between seeds, address and keys

Before we get into the Monero deep, we have to introduce the concept of address generation.

## Elliptic curve

A finite field Fp where p is a prime number, is the field formed by the set {0, 1, 2, ..., p−1}. with arithmetic operations (+, ·) calculated.

Typically, elliptic curves are defined as the set of points (x, y) satisfying an equation:

y^2 = x^3 + ax + b

However, the cryptocurrency Monero uses a special curve known to offer improved security over other commonly used NIST curves, as well as excellent performance of cryptographic primitives.

The curve used belongs to the category of s.c. Twisted Edwards curves, which are commonly expressed as:
ax^2 + y^2 = 1 + dx^2y^2

## Ed25519 Function

Monero uses a particular Twisted Edwards elliptic curve for cryptographic operations, Ed25519, birational equivalent of the Montogomery curve Curve25519.

This curve addresses many concerns raised by the cryptography community. It is well known that NIST4 standard algorithms have
issues. In recent times it has become clear that the random number generation algorithm PNRG is flawed and contains a potential backdoor. Seen from a broader perspective, curves endorsed by the NIST, are also indirectly endorsed by the NSA, something that the cryptography community sees with suspicion. It is well known that NSA has at times used its power over the NIST to weaken cryptographic algorithms.

Curve Ed25519 is not subject to any patents , and the team behind it has developed and adapted basic cryptographic algorithms with efficiency in mind. More importantly, it is currently thought to be secure.

## The address generation

## Keys and Seeds

### Seed and Mnemonic Seeds

A seed is an unique 256bit integer (usually represented as a 64 digit base16 number) for generating keys for unique keys.

_Example_

112699108505435943726051051450940377552177626778909564691673845134467691053980

In hex format

f9296f587419f1cdede67de160fca14d1069ecaa4c52f012af031eea09ee039c

It is actually just a representation of the Private Spend Key itself. This argument is valid only for the Mnemonic style.
This 256-bit scalar can be easily converted to a "24-digit" Base1626 "number" in the form of a mnemonic seed, which is 25 words long with the last word being used as a checksum.

Mnemonics convert on a ratio of 4:3 minimum: four bytes creates three words, plus one checksum word; eight bytes creates six words, plus one checksum word; and so on. The "seeds" created by this method will always be valid scalars as they are sent to sc_reduce32 first. The Private View Key is derived by hashing the Private Spend Key with Keccak-256, producing a second 256-bit integer, which is then sent to the function called "sc_reduce32" that check if the second 256-bit integer is compatible with the elliptic curve.

## Public and Private Keys

Bitcoin uses "asymmetric" style. The "asymmetric" simply means the are two keys:
* the private key (used primarily for signing data and for decrypting data as a transaction )
* the public key (used primarily for signature verification and encrypting data)

This works for Bitcoin, but not for Monero that has 4 keys:

* the public view key - a public key in order to check if it's a valid Monero Address;
* the private view key - a standard key used for viewing data such as the balance , fees and transactions amounts without touching anything related to creating and signing transactions;
* the public spend key - another public key in order to check if it's a valid Monero Transaction;
* the private spend key - a private key in order to sign the transaction, meaning you can spend your Moneroj with this key;

Finally, the Monero Public Addresses are direct representations of the pair of public keys, whereas Bitcoin (and clones) uses a hash of the single public key. EdDSA keys (both private and public) are 256 bits long, or 64 hexadecimal characters. Not every 256-bit integer is a valid EdDSA scalar (private key); it must be less than the "curve order" described with the equation in the Ed25519 function section.

## Monero Public Address

The raw address is useful for things like donations (where you don't care who donated) or exchange withdrawals (where you know the payer out of band). Its strength is simplicity.

Monero standard address is composed of two public keys:
* public spend key
* public view key

It also contains a checksum and a "network byte" which actually identifies both the network and the address type.

## Keys and Address Generation

To add to the confusion, there are presently at least three different methods of private key derivation in existence for Monero, though Bitcoin also has many:

* Original (non-deterministic) Style – The Private Spend Key and Private View Key are both independently and randomly chosen to form an account. There is no good way to back up a nondeterministic account other than keeping copies of the files. For
these reasons, it is not recommended to use an account of this type.

* Mnemonic (Electrum or Deterministic) Style – In this style, the Private View Key is derived from the Private Spend Key, so you only need to remember one thing: the seed, which is actually just a representation of the Private Spend Key itself. The Private View Key is derived by hashing the Private Spend Key with Keccak-256, producing a second 256-bit integer, which is then sent to a function that check if the private key is a valid EdDSA scalar. You can backup accounts of this type by writing down or otherwise saving the 25 word deterministic seed; you can easily restore using both Simplewallet and MyMonero.

* MyMonero Style – This is similar to 2., but uses a 13 word seed instead of a 25 word seed. The 13 words convert to a 128-bit integer that is used for both spend and view key derivation, in the following form: the 128-bit integer is hashed with Keccak-256 to produce a 256-bit integer, a. a is sent to a function, which returns the Private Spend Key. a is hashed once more with
Keccak-256 to produce a second 256-bit integer, b. b is then sent to the same function, which returns the Private View Key based on b. You may have noticed a critical difference between this style and the Electrum Style: MyMonero's Private View Key derivation is done by hashing random integer a, while Electrum Style derivation is done by hashing the Private Spend Key. This means that 13 and 25 word seeds are not compatible – it is not possible to create an Electrum Style seed (and account) that matches a MyMonero Style seed (and account) or vice versa; the view keypair will always be different.

The rest of the address generation process is the same in all three cases. The Private Spend Key and Private View Key are sent to the ed25519 scalarmult function to create their counterparts, the Public Spend Key and Public View Key.

# The Monero Blockchain 

Monero has a unique kind of blockchain. We talked about what a blockchain is and why it is important.
Basically, a blockchain is a distributed public ledger where each payments is recorded. The blockchain cannot be modified due to its distributed nature. It is based on various cryptography protocols and algorithms in order to avoid any cheating.

## Lightning Memory Mapped Database

Monero uses the LMDB database system to store its blockchain. Lightning Memory-Mapped Database (LMDB) is a software library that provides a high-performance embedded transactional database in the form of a key-value store.

LMDB is written in C with API bindings for several programming languages and is developed by Symas Corporation. LMDB stores arbitrary key/data pairs as byte arrays, has a range-based search capability, supports multiple data items for a single key and has a special mode for appending records at the end of the database which gives a dramatic write performance increase over other similar stores.

LMDB is not a relational database but like Berkeley DB and other similar databases such as dbm is strictly a key-value store.

## Block structure

The block structure was defined by the third document of CryptoNote Standards. It defines the way data is stored within blocks and the blockhain along with the corresponding data structures.

A block consists of three parts:
* block header;
* base transaction body
* list of transaction identifiers.

The list starts with the number of transaction identifiers that it contains.

Block Header

## Stealth Addresses

Chapter 3 described a situation where Leo sent George some Monero and in doing so he used George's public keys to produce a one-time public key, also known as a stealth address, that is unlinkable to the George's real keys. This section will go deeper to explain the cryptography behind that one-time public key.

### Sending

The highly technical formula descibed in the CryptoNote whitepaper to produce this public output is `P = Hs(rA|i)G + B`. This means that when Leo wants to send Monero to George he generates a 256 bit pseudorandom scalar to be used as the transaction private key, r. Leo is the only person that will ever know this key, not even George. Leo then multiplies George's public view key, A,  by his pseudorandom scalar and then concatantes the output index, i, to resulting point. This data is then run through the `Hash to Scalar` function. This function takes the input data, hashes it using the Keccak-256 algorithm, then takes that resulting hash modulo the prime number 2^255 + 27742317777372353535851937790883648493. The ed25519 basepoint, G, is then multiplied by the scalar that is output from that function. Finally, Leo adds this point with George's public spend key, B, to produce the final output, P.

### Recieving

Now, as described in chapter 3, George must scan the blockchain for outputs that belong to him. To do this he must calculate `P' = Hs(aR|i)G + B`. The process is very similiar to what Leo had to do to send the Monero. George will get the public transaction key, R, used in the transaction from the blockchain and multiply it by his private view key, a. He then must concatenate the output index to the resulting point and that data through the `Hash to Scalar` function. He then multiplies the ed25519 basepoint, G, by the resulting scalar and finally adds his own public spend key, B, to the resulting point to produce the final point P'. If the output George generated independantly, P', matches the output from the blockchain, P, then George knows that he owns that output and can spend the associated Monero.
