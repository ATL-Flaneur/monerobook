# Monero integration for developers

This chapter covers standards and protocols that developers can use to interact with Monero and build new tools. First, the OpenAlias and Monero URI formats are introduced, as effective ways to communicate addresses and other key details. The rest of the chapter discusses remote procedure calls with integration examples in C++ and python.

## 7.1 OpenAlias: convenient addresses in text (for humans)

It is extremely tricky for anybody without photographic memory to intuitively read and memorize cryptocurrency addresses. A real-life location like “123 Main St” or an email destination like “donate@masteringmonero.com” is much easier to interpret and recall than a Monero address, such as “45ttEikQEZWN1m7VxaVN9rjQkpSdmpGZ82GwUps66neQ1PqbQM no4wMY8F5jiDt2GoHzCtMwa7PDPJUJYb1GYrMP4CwAwNp”.

These cryptocurrency addresses contain a lot of information, but are unwieldy for humans. In fact, there is a famous trilemma known as Zooko's triangle that describes the inherent difficulty of designing name systems that simultaneously meet three criteria: secure, decentralized, and human-meaningful.

The Monero address posted above is not remotely ”human-meaningful,” however it successfully fulfills the other two criteria. Monero public addresses are at least 95 characters long, which is difficult to read and nigh impossible to memorize. Certainly there must be a way to simplify payment destinations!

The Monero Core Team released the OpenAlias standard to “square” Zooko's triangle by creating a human-readable way to communicate addresses. The OpenAlias standard is a text DNS record on a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN). Each text record need only contain two pieces of information: the prefix, and the recipient address. A recipient_name key-value pair can be added as well, however it is not necessary. A typical OpenAlias text record looks like:

    oa1:xmr

    recipient_address=45ttEikQEZWN1m7VxaVN9rjQkpSdmpGZ82Gw Ups66neQ1PqbQMno4wMY8F5jiDt2GoHzCtMwa7PDPJUJYb1GYrMP4C wAwNp

    recipient_name=MoneroFFS

The “oa1:xmr” portion indicates that the record is based on OpenAlias version 1, and that the destination is a Monero address. A recipient name can be optionally specified, in this case “MoneroFFS”.

| Name | Size | Description
-- | -- | --
oa1: |	4	 | The record always starts with “oa1:”, which indicates it is an OpenAlias Version 1 record. If we don't have that prefix we ignore the record, as it may be an SPF record or something else that we don't care about.
symbol |	3 |	The code for cryptocurrency. The code should follow the ISO 4217 Rules: for example for Monero cryptocurrency the simbol is xmr and for Bitcoin the symbol is btc.
recipient_address = address; |	17 + address + 1 |	The recipient address. The format is recipient_address=your_address; where your_address is your cryptocoin address. For Monero, it will be a 95 characters string. Key-value pairs are separated by a semi-colon and, optionally, a space for legibility. This key-value must exist. OpenAlias exists to alias FQDNs to an “address” of any type, and this is expressed in this value.
recipient_name = description; |	14 + description + 1 |	This is not necessary, but useful for the purpose of confirming the correct recipient with the user, or for providing the user with the option of adding an entry to an address book.

The OpenAlias standard is extensible for developers, intuitive for users, and interoperable between both centralized and decentralized domain systems. The standard can be used with any cryptocurrency, and is already implemented by Monero, Bitcoin (Electrum) and HyperStake.

## 7.2 Monero_URI: convenient info in text (for computers)

The Monero uniform resource identifier standard describes a format for unambiguously communicating key data fields for invoices and transactions. These URIs are especially handy for merchandising purposes such as generating QR codes for payments.

Monero's URI syntax follows RFC 3986, and spaces must be x-www-urlencoded as %20. The example URI below URL shows a an example string that encodes a request for a 0.0413 XMR payment sent to address 4BKq...feW5 for the “Mastering Monero book.”

    monero:4BKjy1uVRTPiz4pHyaXXawb82XpzLiowSDd8rEQJGqvN6AD6kWosLQ6VJXW9sghopxXgQSh1RTd54JdvvCRsXiF41xvfeW5?tx_amount=0.0413&tx_description=Mastering%20Monero%20Book

Parameter | Type | Description
-- | -- | --
address |	String |	The raw address
tx_payment_id |	String |	The proposed payment ID of the transaction. (if mentioned)
recipient_name |	String |	The proposed contact name of the recipient. (if mentioned)
tx_amount |	Float |	The proposed amount of the transaction in atomic currency units.
tx_description |	String |	Describes the transaction which should be initiated.

## 7.3 Monero RPC

Developers integrating Monero can choose whether to utilize Monero's C++ API (C/C++) or the remote procedure call (RPC) interface. The RPC methods can be accessed by any programming language with the ability to make HTTP requests, so we'll take advantage of this flexibility and include example code for some common tasks.

The Monero daemon (monerod) is accessible via RPC for key activities such as checking balances or sending funds. The Monero wallet RPC (monero-wallet-RPC) allows you to manage all wallet functionality through JSON calls.

The RPC expresses Monero amounts in “atomic units”, which refers to the smallest fraction of a Monero coin that is recognized by the current monerod implementation. You can convert easily between formats using:

1 XMR = 1x10¹² atomic units

### 7.3.1 Initialization and configuration (setup & secure)

First, launch the Monero wallet RPC, specifying the port and location of your wallet file:

     $ ./monero-wallet-rpc --rpc-bind-port 18082 --disable-rpc-login --log-level 2 --wallet-file your-wallet-file --prompt-for-password
     
If you wish to use a remote node, simply add the --daemon-address flag followed by its address, for example:

     --daemon-address node.moneroworld.com:18089

Since monero-wallet-rpc doesn't bind your IP address and the port by default, you must specify --rpc-bind-ip yourip to connect remotely.

A few security precautions are recommended, since rolling into production with an open RPC interface is like going on a safari with no protection! Be sure to set a username and password before your node is exposed. If you follow these steps to put proper safeguards in place, your API will be safe.

The --restricted-rpc flag is extremely helpful for limiting RPC privileges to avoid potential abuse. For example, the restricted mode ensures that your node will not return privacy-sensitive data by RPC, and prevents external users from activating mining on your devices.

### 7.3.2 JSON RPC Format

JSON-RPC is a stateless, lightweight RPC protocol, using the JSON RFC 4672 data format. The specification primarily defines several data structures, and the rules for processing them. The protocol is transport-agnostic, meaning that its function is independent of the underlying transport mechanism. Thus, the same concepts can be applied within a given process, over sockets, through HTTP connections, or any other communication channel.

In order to receive any information from the wallet RPC, you must send a message with the POST method. The JSON-RPC API accepts messages with the format:
    
    { “jsonrpc” : version , “method” : method, “params”: params, “id”: id }

using inputs described by:
