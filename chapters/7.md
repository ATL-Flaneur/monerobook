# Monero P2P Network and Kovri

The Monero network is entirely decentralized; there is no use of “masternodes” or “coordinators” that some other cryptocurrencies employ. The network is comprised entirely of global interconnected nodes, some of which may choose to mine.

## Nodes

The core of a node is the “monerod” daemon, which synchronizes its own copy of the blockchain and relays data throughout the peer-to-peer network. To interact with the daemon, Monero maintains an official graphical user interface wallet (monero-wallet-GUI) and a command line interface (monero-wallet-CLI). Either can be used to generate keys, sign transactions, etc.

A complete copy of the current blockchain is strictly required to safely craft transactions, so the daemon will need to synchronize with the network before either wallet interface will be able to carry out transaction activity.

Running a “local node” refers to running the daemon on your own device, and interacting with that copy of the blockchain that you maintain. When you run your own local node, you can scan the blockchain and check outputs without having to interact with any third party - just your own copy.

Running a local node requires a fair amount of disk space and bandwidth, which is not suitable for all devices, such as cell phones. You can circumvent the need to store the blockchain on these devices by connecting to a “remote node” instead of a local node. This means that you connect to somebody else’s node and simply ask them to send you information about your outputs. There are no security risks in using a remote node; for example, the node operator will not be able to see your balances or encrypted information. However, there are some privacy concessions, as the node operator will know when your device connects for updates, when you broadcast transactions, and your IP address. Your keys and address are never revealed to the remote node.

## Kovri

Kovri is a new feature that enhances privacy while connecting to the Monero network or broadcasting transactions. Nodes and adversaries with significant resources may use a transaction’s originating IP address to identify the physical location of the sender and create connections between multiple transactions that are believed to come from the same IP address. An unfair node might choose to not relay transactions from certain individuals or groups. Traffic through the cryptocurrency network is currently visible to internet service providers and other surveilling parties, which could put Monero users and node owners at risk if their government or ISP does not endorse cryptocurrencies.

Kovri routing’s technology obscure transmissions sources, decoupling Monero users’ network activity from their IP addresses (and thus their physical location/identity). It is based on the decentralized Invisible Internet Project (I2P) specifications, which uses encryption and sophisticated routing techniques to create private network distributed across the internet.

Kovri will soon be implemented into the Monero wallet, so all transactions will be sent through this private network. Eventually, the entire Monero network will transition to routing through Kovri, although the blockchain may still be stored on the clearnet for efficiency.

The Kovri project is open-source, and depends on the community for support and contributions. The Monero Project is supporting this lightweight security-focused software with a general open-source implementation and common API that can be used for any other application. If you have any questions, or would like to improve or implement Kovri, you can contact the lead developer (anonimal) on the Kovri IRC channels #kovri and #kovri-dev.
