# Monero P2P Network and Kovri

## Nodes

Since Monero has a separate daemon monerod, which synchronises with the network, a command line wallet monero-wallet-cli and a GUI wallet monero-wallet-gui to generate keys, sign transactions etc.

Both wallet versions need a fully synchronised node to scan for new outputs. For best privacy, it's recommended to run an own node (locally or remotely hosted), since you will not disclose for what outputs your wallet is searching on the blockchain. 

However, when you have not the resources available due to a slow internet connection or no option to run a node 24/7, you can connect to an open node over the internet, which will save you bandwidth and disc space. 

The Monero software architecture allows for an easy way to use Monero without downloading the entire blockchain. This is called "using a remote node".

Essentially, your wallet program connects to someone else's monerod (blockchain) program, as known as node.

In any case, the daemon never gets anywhere the wallet's private keys, whether spend or view.

## Kovri

Kovri is a free, decentralized, anonymity technology developed by Monero project.

Currently based on I2Pâ€™s open specifications, Kovri uses both garlic encryption and garlic routing to create a private, protected overlay-network across the internet. This overlay-network provides users with the ability to effectively hide their geographical location and internet IP address.

Kovri is an open-source project, which means that it depends on the community for contributions. The lead developer on the project is anonimal, who you can reach with questions on the Kovri IRC channels #kovri, #kovri-dev, and his Twitter account.

Kovri is being developed under the umbrella of The Monero Project, which is another open-source project that develops the Monero coin and Open Alias. 

The relationship between The Monero Project and Kovri is a mutually beneficial one, with Kovri looking to integrate into the Monero network, and Monero providing a stream of developers and resources for Kovri development.

Kovri will be implemented into the official Monero wallet, so all transactions will be routed through the Kovri anonymous network, hiding the IP address from which the transaction originated. In the future, all transactions will be routed through Kovri by default, although downloading the blockchain will still be through the clearnet for efficiency.
